Stock Price Prediction Web App (09/2022 - 12/2022) Using Machine Learning (LSTM Model) with Streamlit

 In this project we attempt to implement machine learning approach to predict stock prices.
 Machine learning is effectively implemented in forecasting stock prices.
 The objective is to predict the stock prices in order to make more informed and accurate investment decisions.
 We propose a stock price prediction system that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning, and other 
 external factors for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction accuracy and issuing profitable trades.
